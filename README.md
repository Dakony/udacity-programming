# Udacity-Programming for Data Science using Python Nanodegree created By Dakon Plang Josiah

Project 1

Overview

The project comprised of a provided database of movie rentals in which the student have to run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the student's queries.
For the presentation part, the student have to create four slides, and each should have (a) a question of interest, (b) a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question, (c) a supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL queries that answer the questions of interest, and (d) a small summary on each slide.

Project 2

Overview

In this Project, the student will make use of python to explore a data related bikeshare system of three major cities in the United State i.e Chigaco, New York City and  Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows the user to examine an US bikeshare system database and fetch statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.

Project 3

This project comprised in using Git and GitHub with a simulated workflow to refactor Project 2.
